# pwsh-call-operator

*4 May 2024.*

> âœ… ***SOLVED: A change in the default behavior in PowerShell Core was introduced with version 7.3.
  It switched the default mode that was used to pass arguments to external/native commands from
  the now 'Legacy' mode to a new mode. The details of this change can be found in
  [Using Experimental Features in PowerShell / PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/experimental-features?view=powershell-7.4#psnativecommandargumentpassing).***
>
> ***The section calls out that this is a breaking change, however the breaks can happen in very subtle and
  non-obvious ways, so that discovering, debugging and fixing these is not straight-forward.
  And it is referenced in an article called
  [Using Experimental Features in PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/experimental-features?view=powershell-7.4)
  which I wouldn't even have looked at if not for references in other PowerShell issues below.***

There are related topics being discussed on the PowerShell issue tracker though:

* #18961 [Enhance Invoke-Command with parameters that provide ad-hoc overrides of $PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing and $PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/18961#issuecomment-1386218069)
* #21570 [Proposed command Invoke-Process - to solve common problems with Start-Process -Wait and stream redirection](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/21570)

## Preparation

In order for the AzCopy tests to execute you need an [Azure Storage Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview): General-purpose v2 LRS is sufficient.
Follow the preparation steps in [azcopy-call-operator.ps1](./azcopy-call-operator.ps1)!

## Testing

Run the tests by invoking `execute-tests.cmd` from your command shell. It doesn't matter whether it is PowerShell Desktop, Core or the legacy Windows Command shell.

## Expected Results

* **git-call-operator.ps1:** The result should be that the commit hash of tag `pwsh-test-tag-1` is returned in all cases: `c849f18f5839d10936311b2163804cb36bbc88e7`.

* **azcopy-call-operator.ps1:** The resulting content of the Azure Storage Account folder should be the same in all cases, only file `the-only-file-that-should-exist.txt` should be uploaded.

    * The test generates different folders per shell (pwsh, powershell) that is being used to that you can examine the actual contents that is being uploaded.
    * For reference it also creates subfolders `mitigated\pwsh` and `mitigated\powershell` that show the content when the crude mitigation is being applied.
