# Demonstration of Various Bugs

* OPEN: **[pwsh-call-operator](./pwsh-call-operator/README.md)** demonstrates a bug when PowerShell Core provides command line arguments to tools invoked through the [call operator (&)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_operators?view=powershell-7.4#call-operator-), which is a very common usage of the operator and can be found all over the Web.
Even [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/shell/running-commands?view=powershell-7.4#running-powershell-commands) suggests this method for "native commands", which seems to be a euphemism for external tools like `sort.exe` that was used in the next paragraph.
PowerShell Desktop did not show the same behavior therefore, this is even more severe since it can cause problems in subtle and unexpected ways as the code demonstrates with the [AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10) upload.


* FIXED: **[DefaultConnectionLimit](DefaultConnectionLimit/DefaultConnectionLimit/DefaultConnectionLimit.cs)** demonstrates a bug that was introduced with [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/dotnet471-changes.md). Connection-specific configurations are no longer being applied, instead the default settings, like the connection limit, is being used. This can have some serious performance ramifications for applications using different limits for specific connections. The work around described in [ServicePoint.ConnectionLimit default behavior with loopback changed unexpectedly](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net471/KnownIssues/534719-Networking%20ServicePoint.ConnectionLimit%20default%20behavior%20with%20loopback%20changed%20unexpectedly.md) is not really that helpful for these cases.
This issue got resolved with [.NET Framework 4.7.2 preview](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/02/05/announcing-net-framework-4-7-2-early-access-build-3052/).
